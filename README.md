#  UpEarly
*..where the money folders sippin' Folgers be, of course.*

## What is this *"Up Early"*?

UpEarly (TODO: insert phonetic spelling) is a macOS Menu Bar App that gathers my upcomming events and tasks, as well as the local weather via WeatherKit, summarizes my upcomming day, and tells me about it in an accessible way.

## Why would you build this?

I want an easy way to get up to speed on my day ahead. Preferably via spoken natural language. I got up early today and decided I wanted to start making that.

### Minimum Useful Product (MUP):
- Basic integrations with Calendar.app (EventKit), Reminders.app, and WeatherKit.
- Basic summarization via Gemini API or similar.
- TTS via Gemini API (which had thebest quality for cost, last I checked).
- Whatever else I forgot to add to this list.

## And what's gonna happen after that?

### Roadmap (WIP):
- Interface to Things.app (via local App, maybe callback url scheme, or maybe they have a localhost I can GET at. pun intended.).
- Interface to Inoreader.app (likely via cloud API).
- Scheduled batching of event pulls, summary updates, etc.
- App Intents support. Shortcuts, Siri, Spotlight, etc.
- Conversational Interface.
- iOS Version.
- tvOS version.
- A lot of other stuff.
- Ship it. No, no, no, not that kind of... *sighs*
